Question 4 will be using the array stack method in order to solve the “ Longest increasing subsequence problem.” 

The provided Java code defines a class named StackonLIS that contains a main method and a static method named longest_increasing_subsequence.

The main method initializes an array of integers named numbers and then calls the longest_increasing_subsequence method with this array as an argument.

This, which represents the length of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) in the array, is printed to the console.
 
The longest_increasing_subsequence method takes an array of integers as input and calculates the length of the "Longest Increasing Subsequence" using a stack-based approach.

The goal is to find the maximum length of a subsequence of the given array where the elements are in increasing order.
